# Introduction

Currently there exist brushes that are great at being efficient or accurate; not both.

The goal of this study is to find out what different brush types influence the efficiency and accuracy of each brush. It will be your goal to interact with the data with each brush and validate if it is able to cluster the data in a way that you expected it to happen.

The study is divided into five parts. The first part includes a consent form to confirm your willingness to participate and to outline the data available to the researchers. The second part tests the performance of each brush as a manual tool. Following this, a questionnaire will ask users which brush they found most effective. The fourth part tests the same data and brushes but allows for the use of advanced functionalities that enhance stroke accuracy. Finally, the fifth part consists of another questionnaire to determine if the automated features helped users achieve better results compared to manual brushes.

Finally, if you have any questions about the study, feel free to ask the researcher. If you are participating in this study online without the researcherâ€™s supervision, there is a contact button in the top right corner.
